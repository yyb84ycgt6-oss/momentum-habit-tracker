/**
 * generatedAppState — the mutable runtime state a generated app accumulates
 * (a checked-off item, a counter's current value), kept separate from the
 * GeneratedAppSpec it was created from.
 *
 * The split matters for export/import: the spec is the portable definition
 * that travels in an exported file, while this state is local-device data,
 * same as how NotepadApp separates `notepadInitialContent` (portable) from
 * `getFile(fileId)` (local, lib/storage.ts). Keyed by the desktop item's
 * stable id, not the window id, so state survives closing and reopening the
 * window — a re-imported copy of the same app (which gets a fresh item id
 * on import, like every other item type) starts from the spec's defaults
 * rather than inheriting another device's runtime state, which is correct:
 * nothing about "what you last had checked off" should be able to travel
 * inside a file someone else opens.
