/**
 * Widget positions — where the floating widgets live, and how that survives.
 *
 * Every floating widget used to nail itself to the screen with a Tailwind
 * `fixed bottom-4` and stay there forever. Exactly one (FloatingNav) could be
 * moved, because it carried ~95 lines of drag logic of its own and wrote to a
 * key only it knew about. That is why the ⌘ orb would not move: nothing was
 * broken, the capability simply only ever existed in one component.
 *
 * This module is the storage half of the replacement. One key holds a map of
 * widget id → position, so:
 *   • adding a movable widget costs no new storage key,
 *   • "reset every widget" is a single remove rather than a list someone has
 *     to remember to keep up to date.
 *
 * Positions are viewport pixels of the widget's top-left corner. They are
 * clamped on read against the *current* viewport (see `clampToViewport`),
 * which is what stops a widget dragged to the bottom in landscape from
 * sitting off-screen forever after a rotation.
