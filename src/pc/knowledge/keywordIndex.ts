/**
 * Keyword retrieval (TF-IDF) — the floor that always works.
 *
 * The off-grid RAG pipeline this is built alongside retrieves by embedding
 * similarity, which needs an embedding model resident in memory. PC cannot
 * assume one exists: there may be no GPU box reachable, no model downloaded,
 * and no network to fetch one. A search feature that only works when a model
 * is loaded is exactly the kind of thing that is missing when you need it.
 *
 * So this is the always-available tier: pure TF-IDF scoring over the chunk
 * text, no model, no network, no async. Vector search (see vectorMath) is an
 * upgrade layered on top when embeddings happen to be available — never a
 * requirement. The gap between the two is modelled as data (`RetrievalMode`)
 * rather than a branch scattered through callers.
