/**
 * Conductor — automatic sequential pod orchestration
 *
 * Runs a chain of pods one at a time on a single input:
 * hydrate pod -> execute a real task -> compress it back down -> hand its
 * condensed result to the next pod in the chain -> repeat -> compile a
 * final answer from every pod's condensed result.
 *
 * Nothing here is simulated: hydration/compression/task execution all call
 * the real engines already used elsewhere in this package. There is no
 * external model call and no cost — this composes the existing free,
 * deterministic `runPodTask` analysis across multiple pods in sequence.
