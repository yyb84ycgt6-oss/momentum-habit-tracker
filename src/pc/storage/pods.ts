/**
 * Storage pods — more room than one browser bucket allows.
 *
 * ONE CONSTRAINT UP FRONT, because the design depends on it: you cannot get a
 * second 5 MB of localStorage. The quota is per-origin, not per-key-prefix, so
 * "another localStorage pod" would share the same 5 MB and buy nothing.
 *
 * IndexedDB on the same origin is a genuinely separate, far larger bucket —
 * typically hundreds of MB to several GB. So Pod 2 is IndexedDB-backed, which
 * is not a workaround; it is the only real answer, and it gives far more than
 * the 5 MB asked for.
 *
 *   Pod 1 (localStorage) — small, SYNCHRONOUS. Some code must read during
 *     render, and only localStorage can answer without awaiting. That property
 *     is the reason to keep it, not its size.
 *   Pod 2 (IndexedDB)    — large, ASYNCHRONOUS. Everything that can await
 *     belongs here, and anything big belongs here regardless.
 *
 * Pod 2 knows it is Pod 2: it carries its own identity and a record of what it
 * overflowed from, so a bundle exported from one device can be understood on
 * another without guessing which half it is.
