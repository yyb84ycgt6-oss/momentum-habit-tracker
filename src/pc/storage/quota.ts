/**
 * How much room is actually available, asked rather than assumed.
 *
 * A hardcoded ceiling is wrong on every device and goes stale — which is
 * exactly the thing worth not revisiting in a year. `navigator.storage.estimate()`
 * reports what THIS browser on THIS device is willing to give, which on a
 * modern desktop is commonly several gigabytes and on a phone hundreds of
 * megabytes. So the number is measured at runtime, not written down.
 *
 * `persist()` matters as much as the size: without it the browser may evict
 * the whole origin under disk pressure, which for an offline-first OS means
 * losing everything precisely when the network is not there to restore it.
 * Persistence is requested once and the answer is reported honestly, because
 * a browser is allowed to say no.
