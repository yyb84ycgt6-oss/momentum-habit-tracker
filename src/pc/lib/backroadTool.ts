/**
 * The back road as a tool an AI in this app can actually call.
 *
 * The road is useless to an agent it has to be told about in prose. This is
 * the callable surface: a Gemini-shaped function declaration plus the executor
 * behind it, so any tool-calling site wires the whole road in one line.
 *
 * Three functions rather than one, because they answer three different
 * questions an agent has at different moments:
 *
 *   list_destinations  "what is there?"  — before deciding.
 *   open_destination   "take me there"   — and tell me what I found.
 *   open_route         "take me through" — several stops, one call.
 *
 * Every result is a plain object with a `detail` sentence. An agent that has
 * to parse a UI to learn whether its own action worked is an agent that will
 * eventually be wrong about it.
