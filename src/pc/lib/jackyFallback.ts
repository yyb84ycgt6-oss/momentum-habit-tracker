/**
 * jackyFallback — the real implementation of the 'ollama' fallback slot in
 * aiClient.ts. That slot used to return a canned "not integrated" message
 * regardless of whether a real Jacky box was reachable; this makes it an
 * actual call through jackyClient to the real Flask engine on the user's
 * own GPU, mapped into the same AIResponse shape every other provider
 * returns — idea #05, "your own GPU, from your pocket."
 *
 * Local inference through Jacky has no API cost or token metering the way
 * cloud providers do, so tokensUsed/cost are honestly reported as 0 rather
 * than estimated — that is the actual value of owning the hardware, not an
 * approximation of it.
