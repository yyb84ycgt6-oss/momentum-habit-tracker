/**
 * This PC's declared rate limits for @offgrid/predictive-router.
 *
 * The package itself ships no opinion about any provider's numbers — a
 * router library that hardcodes "Groq allows 30 requests/min" stops being a
 * library the moment that changes. This is where Jackie's PC states what it
 * actually knows, so it lives beside the app's own provider roster
 * (ModelProvider in modelRouter.ts) rather than inside the reusable package.
 *
 * Public free-tier figures where documented; anything undocumented is left
 * out entirely, which the ledger treats as unlimited rather than guessed.
 * Correct a wrong number at runtime with quotaLedger.setLimits(), no
 * redeploy required.
