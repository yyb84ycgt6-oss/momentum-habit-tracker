/**
 * Gemini client — the browser half.
 *
 * Ported from Jackie's PC. The client was already a thin `fetch` wrapper
 * around a server relay, so the transport moved across unchanged; only the
 * endpoint differs (a TanStack Start server route instead of PC's Express
 * host). See `src/routes/api/gemini/generate.ts` for the server half.
 *
 * `@google/genai` is deliberately NOT a dependency here. PC imported it only
 * for the `Tool` type and the `Type` enum used in tool schemas — pulling in
 * the whole SDK client-side to get four string constants is not a trade
 * worth making, so the shapes are declared locally. They are the wire format
 * Gemini already expects, so the server relay passes them through untouched.
