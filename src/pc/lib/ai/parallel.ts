/**
 * Parallel — one prompt, many models, at the same time.
 *
 * The gateway answers one question with one model. Owning hundreds of models
 * only pays off if you can put them side by side, so this fans a single
 * prompt across a chosen set and reports each result as it lands.
 *
 * Independent by construction: one model failing, hanging, or rate-limiting
 * must not delay or fail the others, so every contestant gets its own
 * timeout and its own error. `Promise.all` would surrender the whole race to
 * the slowest or unluckiest entrant; this settles each on its own terms.
