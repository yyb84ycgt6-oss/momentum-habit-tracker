/**
 * The back road — one straight line every router can drive.
 *
 * The bus (lib/bus.ts) already connects everything, and lib/bypass.ts lets you
 * WATCH that spine. What neither gives you is a way to TRAVEL it: to say "take
 * me to X" without already knowing which mechanism X happens to live behind.
 *
 * Today that mechanism differs per destination. An app is `launch-app` with an
 * appId. A theme is a raw `pc-set-theme` CustomEvent. A provider is a call into
 * the gateway. A settings pane is an app plus a tab. So every router — the
 * command palette, the router menu, the terminal, voice, automation, deep
 * links, the Understudy — has had to learn all of them, and each keeps its own
 * hand-written list of what exists.
 *
 * Those lists drift, and the drift is not hypothetical: the router menu ships
 * a test that scrapes App.tsx's dispatch branches to catch dead entries, and
 * scripts/gen-pc-apps.mjs parses App.tsx *as text* to find the app roster,
 * because there was no other way to ask. Parsing your own source to learn what
 * you contain is the symptom this file treats.
 *
 * So: one address space, `kind:id` — `app:cortex`, `theme:win95`,
 * `provider:groq`, `verb:command-palette`. One `go(address)`. One
 * `resolve(query)` that every router can share instead of reimplementing.
 *
 * TWO RULES keep this from becoming another list that drifts:
 *
 *   1. THE OWNER REGISTERS. A destination is registered by whatever already
 *      holds the truth about it — App.tsx registers the desktop roster it
 *      builds, the theme registry registers themes, the catalog registers
 *      providers. Nothing here maintains a second copy, so there is nothing
 *      to fall out of sync.
 *
 *   2. TRAVEL IS OBSERVED. Every `go()` reports to the bypass recorder, so
 *      the road can be watched with the same tool that watches the bus. A
 *      shortcut nobody can see is how a codebase gets a hidden second
 *      architecture.
 *
 * What this is NOT: a replacement for the bus. Destinations mostly `go` by
 * emitting on the bus. The back road is an index and an on-ramp, not a
 * parallel transport — building one of those would be the exact tangle it
 * exists to prevent.
