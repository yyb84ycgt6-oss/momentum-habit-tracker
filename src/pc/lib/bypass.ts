/**
 * The bypass — the single line every part of this app connects to.
 *
 * The architecture already works this way: no app imports another. They emit
 * and listen on the Jackie Bus, and each one is a separate lazy chunk. So any
 * app can open without dragging the rest in, and closing one leaves nothing
 * behind. That is the "everything shut off except one or two" property, and it
 * is a consequence of the wiring rather than a feature bolted on.
 *
 * Two things were missing, and this file is both:
 *
 *   SEEING IT. A spine you cannot inspect is indistinguishable from tangled
 *   wiring that happens to work. This records who emits, who listens, and what
 *   has actually travelled, so the connections can be looked at instead of
 *   taken on faith.
 *
 *   KEEPING IT. Nothing stopped an app from importing another directly, which
 *   would quietly reattach two things that are supposed to be independent. The
 *   companion test walks components/apps and fails if one imports another —
 *   the check that keeps the bypass true as the app grows.
 *
 * Recording is off in production by default: the point is inspection during
 * development, not a permanent tap on every message.
