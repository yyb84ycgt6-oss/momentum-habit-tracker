/**
 * Storage that fails loudly instead of silently.
 *
 * Two failure modes this app had no answer for:
 *
 * 1. QUOTA. localStorage is roughly 5 MB. This OS stores desktop snapshots,
 *    a hash-chained time-travel log, knowledge documents and per-app state in
 *    it, so filling it is a matter of when. Every `setItem` throws once full,
 *    and an unguarded call site means the user's work stops being saved with
 *    nothing on screen to say so. Silent data loss is the worst outcome
 *    available, so a failed write is reported rather than swallowed.
 *
 * 2. CORRUPTION. A write interrupted by a crash, a killed tab, or a quota
 *    error mid-string leaves invalid JSON behind. An unguarded
 *    `JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(k))` then throws during render and takes
 *    out whatever was drawing it — an app that will not open until storage is
 *    manually cleared, which most users cannot do.
 *
 * Both are handled here once so call sites do not each need to remember.
