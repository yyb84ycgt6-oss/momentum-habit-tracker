He walked often alone in the dark places of the Void, searching for the Imperishable Flame, but found it not, for it is with Eru alone. Envying his creator, his thoughts turned sour, and as the great choir sang, Melkor introduced a loud, clanging discord—a theme of supreme pride and violent confusion that crashed against the main melody like raging storms.",

Instead, He smiled and rose, introducing a Second Theme, gentle, soft, and infinitely sorrowful, which took the violent discords of Melkor and wove them into its own quiet beauty. When Melkor raged yet louder with a third clanging trumpeting wave, Eru rose again, stern and majestic. He introduced a Third Theme, deep and vast like the ocean, which completely absorbed Melkor's chaos, turning the very noise of discord into a grander, more resilient harmony.",

Warlords like Cao Cao and Yuan Shao amassed massive armies, fighting for control of the imperial throne while the innocent peasantry starved in burning fields. From Changshan, a young warrior named Zhao Yun (Zilong) was chosen by his province to lead an elite brigade of voluntary cavalry to restore order.",

It was there that he met Liu Bei, a modest lord of imperial lineage who lacked land and money but possessed a heart filled with virtue and a deep compassion for the common people. Zhao Yun observed that while other generals chased gold, titles, and land, Liu Bei fought strictly to protect and shield the suffering refugees.",
          "Recognizing a shared spark of moral righteousness, Zhao Yun forged a deep bond with Liu Bei. When his elder brother passed away and Zhao Yun had to return to his home village, he held Liu Bei’s hands and wept, pledging: 'I shall never forget your virtue, nor shall I abandon the path of righteousness.' Years later, Zhao Yun traversed thousands of miles to reunite with Liu Bei, dedicating his life as his supreme shield.",

Near the bridge of Changban, Cao Cao's elite tiger cavalry caught up, scattering Liu Bei's forces in a chaotic night of blood and fire.",

Indeed, Zhao Yun had turned his white stallion back into the jaws of death, riding alone into the sea of Cao Cao's forces to find the missing child.",

Finding Lady Mi wounded by a well, she entrusted the baby to him and threw herself into the depths to avoid slowing him down.

Yet, he soon realized that relying on raw physical strength or mechanical technique was a shallow path to ultimate truth.",

He came to realize that a master swordsman must first and foremost be a master of the human spirit. 'Study strategy over many years and achieve the spirit of the warrior,' he wrote. He understood that true mastery lies in clearing away the dust of ego, material greed, and toxic envy.",
