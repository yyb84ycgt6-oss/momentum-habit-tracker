/**
 * Supervision service — runs the audit on a trigger and surfaces the verdict.
 *
 * The intended trigger is "the account came online", so the first thing that
 * happens after reconnecting is being told whether the fleet built while
 * offline is sound. The audit itself is offline and deterministic; coming
 * online is just when a reviewer becomes reachable.
 *
 * The hard requirement here is NOT crying wolf. A monitor that fires on every
 * launch with the same message gets muted, and then it is worse than nothing
 * because its silence no longer means anything. So:
 *   - an identical report is not re-announced;
 *   - an info-only report is never a notification, only a stored briefing;
 *   - a report that got BETTER is announced too, because "you fixed it" is
 *     information the user needs to trust the tool.
