/**
 * The reviewer briefing.
 *
 * Turns an audit report into a compact, self-contained handover: what was
 * checked, what is wrong, what it will cost the user, and what the reviewer is
 * being asked to decide. Written to be read by a capable model OR by a person —
 * a briefing only one of them can act on is a briefing that rots.
 *
 * Deliberate constraints, because this text is what a reviewer acts on:
 *  - It never invents a fix. The audit reports facts; choosing the change is
 *    the reviewer's job, and pre-filling an answer biases it.
 *  - It states what was NOT checked. A reviewer who assumes the audit was
 *    exhaustive will approve things nobody looked at.
 *  - It stays honest about severity rather than softening, since the whole
 *    point is catching what the author could not see themselves.
