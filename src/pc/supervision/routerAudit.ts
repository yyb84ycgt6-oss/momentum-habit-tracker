/**
 * Router audit — deterministic checks over a hand-built fleet.
 *
 * The point: someone experimenting with their own routers should be told what
 * is wrong BEFORE it quietly degrades the app, and told it without needing a
 * model to be reachable. Every check here is pure and offline; none of them
 * requires an opinion.
 *
 * What this deliberately does NOT do is decide what to change. It reports
 * findings and hands a briefing to a reviewer (a person, or a capable model) to
 * judge. That split matters: facts a machine can verify stay verifiable, and
 * judgement stays with something that can actually reason about intent.
