/**
 * GitHub session and offline cache.
 *
 * Two things were missing from the sync app, and both are the same complaint:
 * closing it lost everything.
 *
 *   RESUME. The repo, the folder you were in, and the file you had open lived
 *   in component state, so reopening dropped you back at an empty box. For an
 *   app that is meant to decompress and recompress constantly, losing your
 *   place every time defeats the point.
 *
 *   OFFLINE. Nothing was cached, so a repo you had already browsed was
 *   unreachable with no network — in an app whose premise is that it works
 *   off-grid. Anything fetched is now kept, and the cache is served first when
 *   the network is gone.
 *
 * Cached entries carry the time they were fetched, and staleness is REPORTED
 * rather than hidden: showing week-old file contents as if they were current
 * is worse than saying plainly that this is what was last seen.
