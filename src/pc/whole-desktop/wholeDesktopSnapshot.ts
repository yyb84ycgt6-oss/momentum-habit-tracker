/**
 * wholeDesktopSnapshot — the shape idea #06 seals: everything needed to
 * rehydrate this desktop exactly somewhere else, in one payload.
 *
 * Deliberately excluded, and why:
 *  - Open windows / focus / z-order: session furniture, not desktop state —
 *    same boundary src/desktop/timeTravel.ts already draws for the same
 *    reason (a real OS restore point captures your files and settings, not
 *    your open tabs).
 *  - Secrets (secretsVault, API keys): never travel in a plain exported
 *    file. A whole-desktop file is meant to be emailed to yourself or
 *    handed to a colleague; a secret sitting in it would be a real
 *    exposure, not a convenience.
 *  - The device's own provenance signing key (src/provenance/deviceKey.ts):
 *    device-specific by design — importing someone else's key onto this
 *    device would be actively wrong, not just extraneous.
