/**
 * FloatingWidget — the wrapper that makes a floating widget movable.
 *
 * Wrap a widget's outermost element in this and it gains drag + persistence:
 *
 *     <FloatingWidget id="command-orb" className="fixed bottom-6 right-6 z-50">
 *         <button …>⌘</button>
 *     </FloatingWidget>
 *
 * `className` still carries the widget's *default* position, so an untouched
 * widget renders exactly where it always did — the inline override only
 * appears once the user has actually moved it. That keeps adoption free of
 * layout regressions: nothing shifts until someone drags it.
 *
 * Move it with a click-and-drag on desktop, or a press-and-hold on touch.
 *
 * There is deliberately no double-click-to-reset here. Floating widgets ARE
 * buttons (the search pill opens the command palette), and the first click of
 * a double-click fires that action before the reset lands — so the gesture
 * would both reset the position and trigger the widget. Reset lives in System
 * Settings → Appearance instead.
