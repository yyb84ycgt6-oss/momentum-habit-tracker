/**
 * Fleet residency — who is awake, and what that costs.
 *
 * The eviction rule is adapted from off-grid-ai-mobile's modelResidency policy,
 * which was written after a real out-of-memory bug: the app held two heavy
 * models at once because a caller consulted the budget and then ignored the
 * verdict. The lesson encoded here is that the decision and its consequence
 * must live in one place — `planWake` returns `fits`, and a caller that ignores
 * it is the bug, so the service never separates the two.
 *
 * Pure: no I/O, no clock of its own, no globals. Same inputs, same plan.
