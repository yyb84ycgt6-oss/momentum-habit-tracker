/**
 * Gives a fleet specialist an actual brain — a Router Forge artifact.
 *
 * This is the piece that turns the fleet from routing-by-declared-domain into
 * routing-by-what-the-question-says. A specialist stays a router, not a
 * language model: the artifact is a hashed n-gram classifier measured in
 * kilobytes, which is exactly why a hundred of them are affordable.
 *
 * The artifact is only compiled while the member is awake. Compiling
 * dequantizes int8 weights into a float matrix, which is the one part with a
 * real memory cost — so it happens on wake and is dropped on sleep, keeping
 * the dormant-costs-zero invariant true rather than merely claimed.
