/**
 * Agent fleet — many small specialists, a few assistants, one coordinator.
 *
 * The shape of the fleet, stated honestly about what each tier can be:
 *
 * - SPECIALIST: a router/classifier, not a language model. Kilobytes, not
 *   megabytes. It does not hold knowledge about its domain; it holds where to
 *   look and who to ask next. This is the only reason 50-100 of them fit — a
 *   500 kB file cannot reason about physics, but it can recognise a physics
 *   question and know which sources and which peer answer it.
 * - ASSISTANT: a small reasoning tier that condenses and negotiates between
 *   specialist outputs. Costs real RAM, so it is capped in count and size and
 *   drops back to zero the moment it is not thinking.
 * - COORDINATOR: the one member that carries actual context about the user and
 *   the vision. Stays warm, because reloading its context is the expensive part.
 *
 * Dormancy is the core rule: a member that is not thinking costs ZERO. RAM is
 * only spent between wake() and sleep().
